    "feedback": "GPT Feedback: The response lacks specificity and detail. While its important to be concise, providing examples or elaborating on key aspects of your experience would enhance clarity and depth. Additionally, structuring your answer by highlighting specific skills or projects can create a more cohesive and informative response. Focus on giving concrete details to improve the overall effectiveness of your answer. Claude Feedback: The response is extremely vague and generic, lacking any specific details or concrete examples. The candidate mentions having technical skills but doesnt elaborate on what those skills are. The answer is poorly structured, consisting of a single unfocused sentence. To improve: 1) Provide specific examples of technical skills, 2) Describe actual implementations or projects, 3) Organize the response with clear points, and 4) Explain how the skills were relevant to the requirements."
